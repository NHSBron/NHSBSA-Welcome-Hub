                      <p>We take pride in placing our people at the heart of our organisation. From the moment you join us, you‚Äôll have access to a range of tools and services designed to support your health and wellbeing. Wellbeing is a key part of everything we do, from everyday conversations with your team to your annual wellbeing check-in with your manager. We‚Äôre committed to supporting you to feel your best in the workplace, based on your own unique needs. </p>

                      <p>We know that mental and physical wellbeing are closely linked. When they're out of sync, our whole wellbeing can suffer. That‚Äôs why we offer a variety of tools and resources to help you manage your physical and mental health. </p>

                      <p><b>Your physical wellbeing</b></p>

                      <p>We offer several resources to help you stay healthy, including free flu vouchers to keep you protected during flu season.
                        We also offer free weekly yoga sessions, focusing on relieving common physical discomforts such as neck, back, and shoulder pain and providing an opportunity to relax and destress. </p>

                      <p>Our occupational health services help us to understand what workplace adjustments can be made to support you at work. These adjustments are available to colleagues with a disability, neurodivergence, long-term health conditions, or caring responsibilities that may impact their ability to perform day-to-day tasks in their role. If you think you may need adjustments, we encourage you to reach out to your new line manager before you start, so we can make sure you're supported as you transition into your new role. </p>

                      <p><b>Your mental wellbeing</b></p>

                      <p>As part of your induction, you‚Äôll complete the ‚ÄòBuilding Resilience‚Äô eLearning module to help you develop the tools needed for managing stress, adapting to change and boosting your overall resilience. We also provide access to Unmind, a mental wellbeing app that includes mindfulness exercises to help reduce stress, anxiety, and promote relaxation.</p>

                      <p><b>Employee Assistance Programme (EAP)</b></p>

                      <p>The EAP is here to support your wellbeing, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. If you need advice or someone to talk to, you‚Äôll have access to a confidential telephone helpline, six free telephone, face to face or online counselling sessions and a dedicated wellbeing portal, providing a range of support, from managing mental and physical health to practical advice on financial and legal matters. </p>

                      <p><b>Safeguarding customers and colleagues</b></p>

                      <p>The NHSBSA has a commitment to safeguarding our customers and colleagues.

                      <p><b>Diversity and inclusion</b></p>

                          <p>Hey, I‚Äôm Anna! I joined the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) in June 2023 as a Portfolio Administration Assistant within Portfolio Management. I recently secured a 12-month
                            secondment as a Project Support Officer ‚Äî I can‚Äôt wait to get started!</p>

                          <p>In the summer of 2013, I graduated from university with a First Class BA Hons in Digital Film Production. After university, my career took many exciting turns, with opportunities working on TV shows and later moving into the fast-paced hospitality sector. </p>
                          <p>However, I found myself looking for a career that offered a different kind of stability and progression. </p>

                          <p>The first step on my journey was completing a Level 2 Certificate in the Principles of Business and Administration. This led me to a variety of administrative roles, from providing client care in a veterinary hospital to serving as a receptionist in a Head Office overseeing care homes and hotels.</p>

                          <p>I‚Äôve always had an appreciation for the NHS and the meaningful work it does. That‚Äôs why, when I spotted the Portfolio Admin Assistant opportunity, I didn‚Äôt hesitate to apply. During the interview process, it was evident that the NHSBSA is dedicated not only to supporting the healthcare system but also to creating a supportive environment for colleagues. An environment that develops, rewards, and recognises everyone. </p>

                          <p>I spent my first six months learning the ins and outs of Portfolio Management, exploring the diverse career paths, different teams, and the day-to-day responsibilities. The variety of roles, from Business Analysis to Assurance to Project Planning and Delivery, really surprised me.</p>

                          <p>Whatever your role here at the NHSBSA, you‚Äôre connected to a truly wonderful colleague experience. I‚Äôve been with the NHSBSA for less than a year and I‚Äôve already participated in numerous training sessions tailored to my current position. Not only that, but I was also given the opportunity to complete the APM Project Fundamentals course. The course enhanced my understanding of project management and played a crucial part in securing my Project Support Officer secondment.</p>

                          <p>Everyone at the NHSBSA has been friendly, supportive, and approachable. The positive culture and genuine care for colleagues are what sets the organisation apart. </p>

                          <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Briony and I‚Äôm part of the Customer Experience Delivery team at the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA). Wondering how I ended up in this role? Let me fill you in.</p>

                          <p>Fresh out of university at 21, I found myself offered a position in the customer contact centre. At that point, my knowledge of the NHSBSA was limited. It wasn‚Äôt until I started to dig a bit deeper that I discovered the NHSBSA‚Äôs crucial role in serving UK citizens, primary care, and the workforce. Here at the NHSBSA, we‚Äôre connected to much more than you think.</p>

                          <p>I quickly settled into the role, fielding calls about dental and prescription exemptions, along with handling enquiries about the NHS Pension. I was dedicated to providing the best service possible, I know that a voice on the phone saying the right things can make all the difference to someone‚Äôs day.</p>

                          <p>While working in the customer contact centre, I joined the internal knowledge help desk and began to help with recruiting and training new employees. I found joy in connecting with a diverse range of people, learning from their different perspectives. </p>

                          <p>When a new role emerged, focusing on developing strategy and performance data, connecting clinical expertise, fostering nationwide connections, and enhancing customer services, I was very interested. I could see that the skills and experience I had gained in the customer contact centre would be well-suited for this role.</p>

                          <p>Navigating a new team, after spending five years in the customer contact centre, felt daunting. However, the support from my new team made the transition easy. At the NHSBSA, I‚Äôve always felt supported to develop, and it‚Äôs this ongoing support that gave me the confidence to apply for my current role in Customer Experience Delivery.</p>

                          <p>I‚Äôm proud to be part of the NHSBSA. With the multitude of opportunities here, there‚Äôs no doubt that I‚Äôll continue to be part of this organisation for many years to come.</p>

                            <p>Hey, I‚Äôm John! I started my journey with the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) as an HR Administrator in HR Shared Services before becoming a Corporate HR Coordinator, and now Corporate HR Advisor. Let me tell you more about my journey! </p>

                            <p>I graduated from Northumbria University in 2020 with a BSc (Hons) in Psychology, followed by a postgraduate programme in Human Resource Management in 2021, the very same year I kicked off my journey with the NHSBSA. Balancing my work and studies wasn‚Äôt always easy, what made it all possible? Well, the flexibility here at the NHSBSA played a huge part. </p>

                            <p>During my time in HR Shared Services, I was given endless opportunities to level up my skills, and I‚Äôm truly thankful for that. The opportunities allowed me to broaden my skills and pushed me to pursue a career in the Corporate HR Team. </p>

                            <p>I value contributing to all things people related. Being a Corporate HR Advisor allows me to make a positive impact on colleagues and managers. What I love most is our collaborative approach, working as a team to develop impactful people initiatives. </p>

                            <p>What truly sets the NHSBSA apart is the wealth of development opportunities. I joined the NHSBSA‚Äôs BAME Leadership Development Programme to strengthen my understanding of effective leadership, influence, and managing others. This experience opened the door to a stretch project, where I led a team in reviewing and enhancing HR policies. One of the things I loved most about the stretch project was the chance to connect with people across the NHSBSA. </p>

                            <p>That‚Äôs not all, I‚Äôm thrilled to share that my efforts were recognised with a Rising Star Highly Commended award at the NHSBSA‚Äôs all colleague WeCARE Awards. Without a doubt, one of my proudest achievements so far!</p>

                            <p>The NHSBSA is the only place I‚Äôve ever worked, and I‚Äôve got to say, I feel lucky to be part of an organisation that truly cares about its people. I‚Äôm all in for building my career right here at the NHSBSA.</p>

                            <p>Hey, I‚Äôm Paula, I‚Äôm delighted to share my journey within Primary Care Services at the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA). In 2008, I graduated from the University of Aveiro with a BA in Public Administration. As if that wasn‚Äôt exciting enough, that very year saw me embarking on another adventure, moving to England!</p>

                            <p>I started at the NHSBSA as a Type 1 Team Member, processing prescriptions at high volume allowing pharmacy contractors to be paid correctly. At the NHSBSA, it‚Äôs all about putting people first, what I truly loved about the role was the flexibility. It allowed me to balance my work and home life in a way that worked for me. </p>

                            <p>After 12 years, the role had become second nature, and I sensed it was time for a change. Unsure of where to start, a Career Pathway with Provider Assurance Ophthalmic came my way,</p>

                            <p>presenting a new challenge in a different area. The transition was a learning curve, but the support I received from the team was incredible. We all had the same shared goal - we‚Äôre all people connected to care, working together to create better health outcomes for everyone.</p>

                            <p>After successfully completing the pathway, I applied for and secured a permanent place within the Provider Assurance Ophthalmic Contract Management Team. </p>

                            <p>My previous role didn‚Äôt involve leading meetings, conducting site visits, or engaging with stakeholders. To address this gap in my experience, I joined Springboard, an NHSBSA development programme for women who want to take control, become more assertive, increase their confidence and enhance their career prospects. This was a transformative step that not only improved my professional skills but also had a positive impact on my personal life. What made it even more remarkable was the unwavering support from our leadership and the accessibility of such programmes across the NHSBSA.</p>

                            <p>Recently, I secured a formal progression opportunity within Assurance Services. It has given me the chance to apply everything I learned during Springboard in a practical setting. </p>

                            <p>I truly believe that the greatest thing about any journey is not so much about how you start, or even where you are now, but how far you are willing to go.</p>
